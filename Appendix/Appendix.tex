\section{Blackbird first split}
\label{app:blkbrd_split}

For the first split of Blackbird, we start by excluding all the yaw forward sequences from the data. We then split the remaining data into in/out-of-distribution based on trajectories. The trajectories we use as in-distribution are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ampersand 
    \item patrick
    \item star
    \item dice
    \item oval
    \item sid
    \item 3dFigure8
    \item bentDice
    \item clover
    \item HalfMoon
    \item figure8
    \item tiltedThrice
    \item thrice
\end{enumerate}{}
