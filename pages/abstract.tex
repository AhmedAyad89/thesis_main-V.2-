%TODO: Abstract
Out-of-distribution(OOD) detection, is becoming a crucial problem for modern machine learning. As models are being deployed in critical systems, we need a robust estimate of the model's certainty over its predictions. We argue that reliable uncertainty estimation must take into account the \emph{similarity} between the current input and the training distribution. Accordingly, we present a recurrent compression model which can detect low-probability inputs.
